    "color_grading": {
        "palette": "Desaturated cool-gray dominant with monochromatic tendencies, subtle warm amber accent from interior lighting , muted greens in foliage, steel blue-gray sky",
        "saturation": "Low saturation (60-70%), chromatic reduction for cinematic realism, selective desaturation on background buildings while preserving slight warmth on subject architecture",
        "contrast": "Very low contrast, lifted blacks (crushed blacks avoided), flattened tonal curve for matte cinematic look, reduced clarity for atmospheric softness"

    "texture_quality": {
        "details": "Wet asphalt reflecting light, fog particles in atmosphere, soft tree foliage detail, architectural glazing reflections, subtle vehicle motion blur",

        "mood": "Cinematic urban melancholy, mysterious and contemplative, sophisticated metropolitan solitude, quiet drama in everyday cityscape",

    "technical_quality": {
        "post_processing": "Atmospheric haze enhancement, lifted blacks for matte film look, clarity reduction for softness, cinematic color grading with teal-shadows and subtle warm highlights, perspective correction for building horizontals, subtle grain addition for texture, reflection enhancement on wet ground",
        "white_balance": "Cool shifted to 6500-7000K with magenta tint reduction, creating blue-gray cast typical of overcast/fog conditions",
        "tone": "Log-like tonal curve with compressed highlights and lifted shadows (flattened S-curve), high dynamic range preservation, matte finish avoiding pure blacks or whites",
        "vignette": "No vignette or extremely subtle (-5%) to maintain open atmospheric feel, possible slight edge darkening only to draw eye to center",
        "dynamic_range": "High dynamic range capture (14+ stops) preserving detail in bright foggy sky and simultaneously in shadowed building undersides and tree canopies"
